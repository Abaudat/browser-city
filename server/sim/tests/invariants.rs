//! Registry of the invariants named across the architecture and requirements
//! (NFR25, NFR28, NFR29, and Story 0.16's acceptance criteria). Each constant
//! documents one invariant by its trace-matrix id. `docs/trace-matrix.md`
//! records, for every id here, whether it is `covered` (a test with the same
//! name exists) or `deferred` (the subsystem it protects does not exist yet).
//! `scripts/ci/check-trace-matrix.sh` fails the build if the two ever
//! disagree, so this file and the matrix cannot drift silently.
